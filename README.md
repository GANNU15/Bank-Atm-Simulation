# 🏦 Bank ATM Simulation (Java) 

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a **console-based Bank ATM Simulation project** developed using **Java** as part of a learning module. It simulates essential ATM functionalities like checking account balance and withdrawing money. The project introduces the concept of **synchronization** in Java by making the `checkBalance()` and `withdraw()` methods thread-safe.
